# darlingbot

darlingbot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

<h2>1. Cats</h2>
Anytime a user in the channel uses the word "cats" my darlingbot will respond with "Jen Krepelka thinks cats are cute!" It's pulling my real name with the user.real_name command.

<h2>2. Fortune Cookie</h2>
Anytime a user types "fortune cookie" in the channel my darlingbot will respond with a random fortune.

<h2>3. What should I eat?</h2>
Anytime the users directly addresses my bot (@hubot-2) with the question "what should i eat?", my darlingbot will reply with "Are you a vegetarian?" If the user then directly addresses my bot (@hubot-2) with "yes" or "no" it will respond with a random suggestion of what to eat based on dietary preferences.
